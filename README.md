## Hyfer

This is a small setup for the project. `react-router-dom` is added and configured so please take a look in `app.js` to how it all work.

Also [css modules](https://github.com/gajus/react-css-modules) is activated, it's an easier way of styling without caring about if class names collide. Please take a look at css modules.

The structure is made so that it's not so hard to integrate you already built parts of the project.
